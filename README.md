# CraveFood---Node-Express-HandleBars-MySQL
An app to maintain a checklist of food that you crave for
CraveFood is an app that lets users input the names of food they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a name of the dish, the app will display that on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each dish in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the dish will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every dish's name and details in a database, whether devoured or not.
